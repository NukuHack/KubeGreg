just some external stuff I save here ... is not really useful

fission reactor

usable things :
megacells:sky_steel_ingot
megacells:sky_steel_block
dmlreloaded:machine_casing
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_plate
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_redstone

max int : 2,147,483,647 .... 2147483647
  aka 2 in the power of 31 minus one = 2^31 - 1


Plan :
    all done (for now)



welp some gitting xD




Key Process Overview for Toluene Production:

Oligomerization to Form Larger Hydrocarbons (C6 and C7) from C2 Compounds**:

Once you have ethylene and acetylene, they can undergo oligomerization reactions to form benzene (C6H6) and other aromatics.
Catalyst: Zeolite-based catalysts (like ZSM-5) are highly effective for promoting the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons.
Reaction Conditions: Moderate temperatures (400–600°C or 673–873 K) and pressures around 1–5 atm can encourage the formation of benzene and other aromatics from smaller hydrocarbons.

Alkylation and Methylation of Benzene to Form Toluene:

Benzene can be methylated with methanol (CH4O) to produce toluene (C7H8).
Reaction Conditions: 300–500°C (573–773 K) with moderate pressure is ideal.
Catalyst: Acidic catalysts like AlCl3 or zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5) help promote the methylation of benzene to produce toluene.

Stage 2: Oligomerization to Aromatics

Temperature: 673–873 K (400–600°C)
Pressure: 1–5 atm
Catalyst: Zeolite (ZSM-5)
Products: Benzene, small aromatics
Stage 3: Methylation to Form Toluene

Temperature: 573–773 K (300–500°C)
Catalyst: Acidic catalyst (AlCl3 or ZSM-5)
Reaction: Benzene + Methyl radical or methanol → Toluene





Inconel Alloys: These are nickel-chromium-based superalloys that maintain mechanical properties at high temperatures.
Hastelloy: Another nickel-based alloy that offers high strength and resistance to oxidation.
Ceramics: Advanced ceramics could also be used in areas where high thermal stability and chemical resistance are critical.
