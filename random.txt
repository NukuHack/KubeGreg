just some external stuff I save here ... is not really useful

fission reactor

usable things :
megacells:sky_steel_ingot
megacells:sky_steel_block
dmlreloaded:machine_casing
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_plate
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_redstone

max int : 2,147,483,647 .... 2147483647
  aka 2 in the power of 31 minus one = 2^31 - 1


Plan :
    Gianormus cracker
	insainly huge pyro-oven
	maybe a huge ass implosion comp.
	maybe a try for huge assembly line ?
	maye maybe ... big crafter (vanilla crafting)
	maybe a Fission reactor
	maybe a paralelle fusion reactor
	maybe a giant alloy blast smelter
	balance the large farm  (change it to farm and make another multiblock named large farm)
		cactus to the farm
		sea pickles to there ... or
		maybe a multiblock like Flower Garden
	balance the tree greenhouse a bit too
		cocobeans to the jungle
		apples for oaks
	Large inscriber (paralelle)
	
	change the black steel to red steel inside "strong mix"
	
	maybe a big multiblock for paralelle sim_chamer + loot_fabric (like in Nomifactory)
	
	change the recipe for dye
		(make the mixtures like magenta craftable from basic elements like red)
		remove the red dye tag from redstone
		remove the gray dye tag from metal_mixture
		lapis dye recipe should have a mortar
			bonemeal to white dye too
	
	making flourite ore (calcium 2x fluoride)
		CaF2
	making fluoric and hydrofluoric acid in a normal way not so stupid
		CaF2 + H2SO4 â†’ 2 HF + CaSO4
	
	sulfurous acid : H2SO3 (sulfuric acid is 4O)
		in order to make sulfuric acid in a better way
		SO2+HCl+H2O -> H2SO3 + HCl
		SO2+2Cl+2H2O -> H2SO4 + 2 HCl
		SO2+H2O -> H2SO3
		SO3+H2O -> H2SO4
		H2SO3 + O -> H2SO4

	pyro-oven assembling

	realistic ae2
	
	
welp some gitting xD




custom multiblock (if there will be any)

Inconel Alloys: These are nickel-chromium-based superalloys that maintain mechanical properties at high temperatures.
Hastelloy: Another nickel-based alloy that offers high strength and resistance to oxidation.
Ceramics: Advanced ceramics could also be used in areas where high thermal stability and chemical resistance are critical.
