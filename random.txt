just some external stuff I save here ... is not really useful

usable things :
megacells:sky_steel_ingot
megacells:sky_steel_block
dmlreloaded:machine_casing
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_plate
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_redstone

max int : 2,147,483,647 .... 2147483647
  aka 2 in the power of 31 minus one = 2^31 - 1


Plan :

	maybe a big vanilla crafter

	sea pickles to Large Farm ... or
	    maybe a multiblock like Flower Garden for dies

	make the mixtures like magenta craftable from basic elements like red

    potato concrete
        potato starch + Regolith (lifeless dirt) + salt = best concrete
            potato starch < wet potato s. < potato slurry < crushed potato
            regolith < basalt powder + iron oxides


	(more) realistic ae2

	fine_ruthenium_trinium_americium_neutronate : wire
	
	gfs:quasi_stable_neutron_star
	
	gfs:the_ultimate_material
	
	sculk_superconductor: wire


welp some gitting xD




custom multiblock (if there will be any)

Inconel Alloys: These are nickel-chromium-based superalloys that maintain mechanical properties at high temperatures.
Hastelloy: Another nickel-based alloy that offers high strength and resistance to oxidation.
Ceramics: Advanced ceramics could also be used in areas where high thermal stability and chemical resistance are critical.


let a = [0,1];
let welp = 0;

function fibo(a){
    if (x<2){
        return a[x]
    }
    else{
        welp = a[0]+a[1];
        return (welp);
        a[0]=a[1];
        a[1]=welp;
    }
}

let x = 0;
while (true){
    console.log(fibo(x));
    x++;
}
