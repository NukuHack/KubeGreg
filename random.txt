just some external stuff I save here ... is not really useful

usable things :
megacells:sky_steel_ingot
megacells:sky_steel_block
dmlreloaded:machine_casing
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_plate
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_redstone

max int : 2,147,483,647 .... 2147483647
  aka 2 in the power of 31 minus one = 2^31 - 1


Plan :
	Large pyro-oven
	maybe a big vanilla crafter

	sea pickles to Large Farm ... or
	maybe a multiblock like Flower Garden for dies
	make the mixtures like magenta craftable from basic elements like red

    potato concrete
        potato starch + Regolith (lifeless dirt) + salt = best concrete
            potato starch < wet potato s. < potato slurry < crushed potato
            regolith < basalt powder + iron oxides
	
	realistic ae2
	
	polyethyl_cyanoacrylate // replaced with PEEK
	
	fine_ruthenium_trinium_americium_neutronate : wire
	
	gfs:quasi_stable_neutron_star
	
	gfs:the_ultimate_material
	
	sculk_superconductor: wire


welp some gitting xD




custom multiblock (if there will be any)

Inconel Alloys: These are nickel-chromium-based superalloys that maintain mechanical properties at high temperatures.
Hastelloy: Another nickel-based alloy that offers high strength and resistance to oxidation.
Ceramics: Advanced ceramics could also be used in areas where high thermal stability and chemical resistance are critical.
