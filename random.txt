just some external stuff I save here ... is not really useful


max int : 2,147,483,647 .... 2147483647
  aka 2 in the power of 31 minus one = 2^31 - 1


Plan :
	maybe a big vanilla crafter

	maybe a multiblock like Flower Garden for dies (and other related nature stuff)

	make the dye mixtures like magenta craftable from basic elements like red

    potato concrete
        potato starch + Regolith (lifeless dirt) + salt = best concrete
            potato starch < wet potato s. < potato slurry < crushed potato
            regolith < basalt powder + iron oxides

	void - infinity tier

	ways of getting to the uhv++

	(more) realistic ae2

mat1 : frame,gear,small_gear,plate,double_plate
mat2 : plate,long rod,rod,ring,round,screw,dusts
wire2 : fine_wire,gear,small_gear,large_fluid,rotor,foil
wire1 : wire,fine_wire

welp some gitting xD




custom multiblock (if there will be any)

Inconel Alloys: These are nickel-chromium-based superalloys that maintain mechanical properties at high temperatures.
Hastelloy: Another nickel-based alloy that offers high strength and resistance to oxidation.
Ceramics: Advanced ceramics could also be used in areas where high thermal stability and chemical resistance are critical.
