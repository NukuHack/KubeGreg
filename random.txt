just some external stuff I save here ... is not really useful

usable things :
megacells:sky_steel_ingot
megacells:sky_steel_block
dmlreloaded:machine_casing
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_plate
dmlreloaded:soot_covered_redstone

max int : 2,147,483,647 .... 2147483647
  aka 2 in the power of 31 minus one = 2^31 - 1


Plan :
    Large cracker - complete
	Large inscriber - complete
	Large pyro-oven
	maybe a huge implosion comp.
	maybe a huge assembly line
	maybe a big crafter (vanilla crafting)
	maybe a Fission reactor
	maybe a paralelle fusion reactor
	maybe a giant alloy blast smelter

	sea pickles to Large Farm ... or
	maybe a multiblock like Flower Garden for dies
	make the mixtures like magenta craftable from basic elements like red

    potato concrete
        potato starch + Regolith (lifeless dirt) + salt = best concrete
            potato starch < wet potato s. < potato slurry < crushed potato
            regolith < basalt powder + iron oxides

	realistic ae2


welp some gitting xD




custom multiblock (if there will be any)

Inconel Alloys: These are nickel-chromium-based superalloys that maintain mechanical properties at high temperatures.
Hastelloy: Another nickel-based alloy that offers high strength and resistance to oxidation.
Ceramics: Advanced ceramics could also be used in areas where high thermal stability and chemical resistance are critical.
